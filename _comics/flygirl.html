<p>Minneapolis is a young and ambitious trans woman. With her cybernetic wings, she’s reinvented the postal service in her home city of…well, Minneapolis…and she’s looking for something to do next. So, she joins up with the fuel-stealing trashmoon pirates to try and bring down the great Captain with her terrible expanse of wings. But the Captain’s got other concerns - how will she rescue the trashmoon citizenry from exploitation by the countries of the earth?</p>

<p>The Captain’s experience and cynicsm against Minneapolis’ leadership and naivete. The two greatest flyers in the history of pteroplasty. And, maybe, a common cause of freedom to unite these women in the most audacious heist ever conceived.</p>

<p>Ongoing serialized illustrated short story, written by Caroline Kittredge Faustine and illustrated by Molly Liu, January 2016 to the present.</p>
