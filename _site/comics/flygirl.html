		<p>Minneapolis is a young and ambitious trans woman. With her cybernetic wings, she’s reinvented the postal service in her home city of…well, Minneapolis…and she’s looking for something to do next. So, she joins up with the fuel-stealing trashmoon pirates to try and bring down the great Captain with her terrible expanse of wings. But the Captain’s got other concerns - how will she rescue the trashmoon citizenry from exploitation by the countries of the earth?</p>

<p>The Captain’s experience and cynicsm against Minneapolis’ leadership and naivete. The two greatest flyers in the history of pteroplasty. And, maybe, a common cause of freedom to unite these women in the most audacious heist ever conceived.</p>

<p>Ongoing serialized illustrated short story, written by Caroline Kittredge Faustine and illustrated by Molly Liu, January 2016 to the present.</p>

      <p><p>When the captain wheeled herself into the cabin she recognized the paintings on the wall but bumped into a coatrack she wasn’t expecting, knocking it down. Her old partner’s spouse picked it up and smiled, then opened a far door for her. She had already forgotten their name since she was not here to see them. She maneuvered around more familiar things unfamiliary arranged and entered through the open doorway.</p>

      <p><p>Minneapolis burst through the dark hardwood doors of the captain’s cabin and crouched on the floor, her wings a shield in front of her. She grabbed the electric baton at her waist and braced for gunfire.</p>
